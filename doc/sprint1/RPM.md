4. Risk & Blockers
 * Resource Allocation: With Amy's tasks complete, resources can potentially be reallocated to assist Anbo with Homecare Rehab or to expedite Email Verification.
 * Integration: Need to ensure the newly completed Login flow integrates seamlessly with the pending Email Verification.
5. Next Steps
 * Code Review: Review Amy's changes for Login and Service Selection.
 * Reassignment: Assign a specific owner to finish the Email Verification task (potentially Amy now that she is free?).
 * Sprint Goal: Focus team efforts on unblocking Anbo's Homecare Rehab progress.
